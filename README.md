## development / build from source

1. clone this repo.
2. run `npm i` (you must have node.js).
3. run `npm run dev` to run just the webpage in dev mode at `http://localhost:5173`.
4. run `npm run watch` to build the extension and watch for changes. this can be used with `web-ext run` to test in firefox.
5. run `npm run build:firefox` or `npm run build:chrome:prod` to build for production. the built extension will output to `dist/firefox` or `dist/chrome` respectively.
